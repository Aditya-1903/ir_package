#### 20XD96: Information Retrieval and Web Search Lab  

#### Fine Tuning CLIP on custom dataset  
The project effectively showcases the application of a fine tuned CLIP model for cross-modal retrieval in the fashion domain. By leveraging CLIPâ€™s powerful multimodal embeddings and aligning them through fine-tuning, the model demonstrates strong retrieval accuracy for both text and image queries.
